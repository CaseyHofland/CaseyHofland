Hi ho! I'm a rigorous developer who focuses on building stable and reusable solutions. I prefer a combination of Component-based and Pain Driven Development, ensuring quick results that are designed to be extended.

<br/>

I won't lie: I'm stubborn. I like to do it right. I research before I implement, I overhaul when I discover improvements and it's not finished until it's documented. I love to focus on a single long-term system rather than juggle dozens of features. I give 3x my output solo-developing generic Unity systems for reusability, ease-of-use and other buzzwords (it's quality code is the point). But don't take my word for it: just browse some of my reusable packages and see for yourself!

<br/>

Find me alone in an empty room, and there's a good chance you'll walk in on me mulling over implementation details and browsing through the Unity Forums. Work ends, but creativity hits any time of the day. When it does, I'll be looking into APIs and documentation before the glare of the sun leaves my screen as it sets. Else, I regularly check up on upcoming Unity features and coding tricks to get ahead of the curve.
