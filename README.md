# Casey Hofland

I am a dedicated, driven and determined developer who focuses on building stable and reusable solutions. I prefer a combination of Component Based and Test Driven Development, ensuring results that are designed to be extended.

<br/>

I have an honest devotion and passion towards durable, high quality code, and know when to invest more time to deliver something truly comprehensive.

<br/>

Research before, overhaul during, update after. Technical debt arises from dependencies, so I design my systems as generic solutions that slot into existing frameworks. I love to focus on a single long-term system and give 3x my output developing for quality, reusability and ease-of-use.
